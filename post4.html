<p>With the increasing popularity of&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-style/dark-side-of-social-media-influencing-7918524/" class="">influencers</a></strong>&nbsp;and a social media culture that rewards ‘perfection’, fitness, for many, has now become a trend, instead of something you pursue to lead a healthy life. As with the growing influence of any trend — there are always myths that come with it that you should not blindly believe.</p>

<p><strong>The more you sweat, the more calories you burn</strong></p>

<p>“<strong><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/sweat-it-out-here-are-some-benefits-of-sweating-8001504/" class="">Sweating</a></strong>&nbsp;and burning calories are not directly proportional. You could work out on a hot sunny day and sweat more, and do the same workout in an air-conditioned room, you’ll still burn the same amount of calories,” she explained.</p>

<p><strong>Crunches will give you the sculpted abs you’re dreaming of<br></strong><br>Avani said that you could do 100 crunches for 100 days and still not see any ab in sight. “Instead, focus on a mix of strength training and endurance exercises while managing your <strong><a class="" href="https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/food-wine/foods-pre-post-swimming-health-benefits-7958889/">nutrition</a></strong> to develop abs.”</p>

<p><strong>No pain, no gain<br></strong><br>“That’s definitely a mantra you don’t want to follow,” she said. “Experiencing zero to mild&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/feeling-sore-three-natural-things-pain-relief-pain-management-7393557/" class="">soreness</a></strong>&nbsp;for 24-48 hours after a workout is acceptable, but anything beyond that after every workout can be a sign of something more serious.”</p>

<p><strong>You can workout to lose weight at certain spots on your body<br></strong><br>“Spot reduction is not a real thing,” Avani explained, adding that the concept of&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/good-healthy-weight-loss-body-belly-fat-percentage-muscle-benefits-8161452/" class="">weight loss</a></strong>&nbsp;is simple – consume lesser calories than you burn. “The body decides where to burn the fat from. However, exercising certain muscles of the body helps tone the muscle, making it look leaner.”</p>
