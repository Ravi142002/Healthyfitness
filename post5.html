<p>Investigators from Cedars-Sinai Cancer have identified an investigational therapeutic approach that could be effective against treatment-resistant prostate cancer. Results of their Phase II clinical trial, published in the peer-reviewed journal <em>Molecular Therapy, </em>have led to a larger, multicenter trial that will soon be underway.</p>

<p>Cancer of the prostate, a small gland just below the bladder, is the second-leading cause of cancer-related death in men. Many prostate tumors are not aggressive and may require no or minimal treatment. Aggressive tumors are initially treated with surgery or radiation therapy.</p>

<p>In about one-third of patients, the cancer comes back after initial treatment, said Neil Bhowmick, PhD, research scientist at Cedars-Sinai Cancer, professor of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences and senior author of the study. Those patients are usually treated with medications that suppress the actions of testosterone and other androgens -- male hormones that help prostate tumors grow.</p>

<p>"Patients do really well until the tumor figures a way around the androgen-suppressing therapy," Bhowmick said. "One way that it can do this is to cause cells to make only part of the protein that the drug binds to, rendering the drug useless. The partial proteins are called splice variants."</p>
