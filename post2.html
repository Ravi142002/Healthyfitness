<p>In winters, people tend to get lazy and skip their workout sessions to enjoy the comforts of their quilts and to spend a few extra hours underneath them.

<p>If you have been working out, it is suggested that you continue to stay active. For others, who are prone to bouts of lethargy, Aditi Gupta, premium coach at FITTR says the chilly weather “not only makes us lazy, but also slows down weight loss due to a reduction in sweating”.</p>

<p>Exercising in winters is particularly difficult. If you choose the correct activity, you won’t have to work out outside in the bitter cold. Joining a local recreational sports team or enrolling in fitness classes are two ways to stay active,” she says.</p>

<p>Gupta says if you’re unclear about what is possible for you to do, seek advice from a personal trainer, exercise physiologist, or other health specialists. “Your ambitions don’t have to be big. While finishing a marathon is an admirable goal, so is being able to walk from shop to shop without stopping.”</p>
